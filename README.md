# language-asm-avr package

Language package for AVR Assembly and Disassembly code.

This is a continuation of the language-avr-assembly package, as I have lost the ability to edit it.

I have also added in autocomplete snippits
	For example: When typing in "ADD", it will autocomplete to "ADD Rd,Rs" if you choose to. This is currently a WIP as I finish adding in all of the intructions available, however the ones I have added all work.
